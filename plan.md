## 5. User experience
### 5.1. Entry points & first-time user flow
- A new user arrives at the landing page, which clearly explains the product's value and prompts them to sign up.
- The sign-up process is simple, requiring only an email and password.
- Upon first login, the user is greeted with a clean dashboard and a simple tutorial or prompt guiding them to add their first RSS feed.

### 5.2. Core experience
- **Dashboard**: Upon login, the user lands on their main dashboard, which displays the latest unread articles from all their subscriptions.
- **Adding a feed**: The user clicks a prominent "Add Feed" button, pastes a URL, and the system quickly validates and adds it to their subscription list.
- **Reading**: The user clicks on an article title, and the content is displayed in a clean, uncluttered reader view, free of external website ads or navigation.
- **Organizing**: The user can drag and drop feeds into different categories they create, making it easy to switch between reading contexts like "Work News" and "Personal Hobbies."

### 5.3. Advanced features & edge cases
- The system should gracefully handle invalid or broken RSS feed URLs during the subscription process.
- The application should prevent the display of duplicate articles if they appear in multiple feeds.
- A "Mark all as read" option will be available for users to quickly clear their unread queue.
- Importing and exporting subscriptions via an OPML file will be considered for a future release.

### 5.4. UI/UX highlights
- A minimalist, content-focused design that prioritizes readability.
- A fully responsive interface that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.
- Fast and fluid navigation, with Redis caching ensuring near-instant load times for feeds and articles.

## 7. Success metrics
### 7.1. User-centric metrics
- Daily and Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU).
- Average number of feeds subscribed per user.
- User retention rate over a 30-day period.
- User satisfaction score (measured via optional in-app surveys).

### 7.2. Business metrics
- User account growth rate.
- Conversion rate from landing page visitor to registered user.

### 7.3. Technical metrics
- API endpoint response times (p95 and p99 latencies).
- Application uptime and availability (target 99.9%).
- Background feed fetch job success rate and average processing time.
- Error rates for both frontend and backend services.

## 8. Technical considerations
### 8.1. Integration points
- **Clerk**: For handling all user authentication, session management, and user profiles. This will be the primary integration for user management.

### 8.2. Data storage & privacy
- MongoDB will be used to store application-specific data like user subscriptions and article metadata.
- User credentials and sensitive personal data will be managed and stored securely by Clerk, offloading the most critical security responsibilities from our application.
- The application will have a clear privacy policy, and user data will not be shared with third parties.

### 8.3. Scalability & performance
- Redis will be implemented for caching parsed RSS feeds and article data to minimize database load and reduce latency.
- The Node.js backend will be designed to run in a clustered environment to handle concurrent users.
- A background job processing system (e.g., BullMQ) will manage feed fetching asynchronously to prevent blocking the main application thread.

### 8.4. Potential challenges
- Handling the variety and inconsistency of different RSS and Atom feed formats.
- Managing rate limits and preventing IP blocks when fetching a large number of feeds.
- Ensuring the feed fetching mechanism is robust and can recover from failures.
- Designing an efficient database schema to handle a large volume of articles and user subscriptions.
### 8.5. Data sources
- **User-Subscribed Feeds**: The primary source of content will be the RSS/Atom feeds that users subscribe to by providing a direct URL.
- **Feed Discovery Service**: To help users discover new content, we can integrate with a third-party API or build a simple discovery feature. This feature would allow users to search for topics or websites and get suggested RSS feeds.
- **Curated Starter Feeds**: For new users, we can provide a pre-populated list of popular and high-quality feeds across various categories (Technology, News, Design, etc.) to showcase the application's value immediately.
